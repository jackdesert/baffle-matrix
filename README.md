A study of rollover baffles of various lengths and angles

A study of baffle length and baffle angle.

Poses the question:
A study of baffle length vs baffle angle
The que

Say you are looking for a particular amount of edge in your tone.
Say you want to get that edge by incorporating a rollover baffle in your design.

This study demonstrates that for short baffles (8mm or less in length),
the amount of perceived edge is a function of at least baffle_length and
baffle_angle.

Jack's Favorites from listening to the recordings
-------------------------------------------------

Of the ones I said I liked when recording...the ones with the
shallower angle (and very short length) seem to have
more personality than the wider-angle-but-longer baffle.

Parametric Study of Rollover Baffle Geometry
--------------------------------------------

I'm learning to design, build, and repair mouthpieces. Especially of interest to me is how to construct a baffle to give a particular timbre.

Today I added several different wax rollover baffles to an unbranded, otherwise-dark-sounding baritone mouthpiece. With each new wax rollover baffle, the dimensions of the baffle were written down and a recording of the D minor scale was made.

Here is a sketch showing the dimensions referenced:

The real intent of the exercise is to find commonalities between timbres of different geometries. That is,
The real intent of the exercise is to identify the dimensions of a baffle that have the most impact on the timbre. And then to find out if there are multiple combinations of those dimensions that can yield the same timbre.

For this parametric study, two values of C are used, and several values of A.
C is a linear measurement that reflects the angle of the baffle. Small values of C
represent shallow baffle angles, and large values of C represent steep baffle angles.

A is the length of the baffle from the tip rail.

Here is a photo of one of these wax baffles. The measurements of this one are A=2.3, C=0.

For simplicity these rollover baffles actually have sharp edges. The baffle angle was established by
scraping the wax with a flat object with one end of the flat object resting atop the tip rail and the other end of the flat object resting either at the base of the window (C==0) or 5mm below the base of the window (C==5). This gives a clean, repeatable angle.

Establishing the baffle length (A) was more akin to "shave and check". The same flat object was used to establish the back side of the baffle, and after a few scrapes the baffle length (A) was measured. Once the length was deemed appropriate for the next reading, a recording was made.



## Experiment Description

### Objective
The objective of this experiment is to explore the effects of varying the length and angle of the saxophone mouthpiece baffle on the produced sound.

### Variables
- **A (Length of the Baffle):** This variable represents the length of the baffle inside the saxophone mouthpiece. The length is denoted by the value following `a` in the filenames (e.g., `a0.0`, `a0.5`, `a1.0`, etc.).
- **C (Angle of the Baffle):** This variable represents the angle of the baffle inside the saxophone mouthpiece. The angle is denoted by the value following `c` in the filenames (e.g., `c0`, `c5`).

### Method
1. **Preparation of Mouthpieces:**
   - Multiple saxophone mouthpieces were prepared with different lengths and angles of the baffle.
   - The length of the baffle (A) was varied in specific increments (e.g., 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, etc.).
   - The angle of the baffle (C) was set to either 0 or 5 degrees.

2. **Recording:**
   - A series of sound recordings were made with each mouthpiece configuration.
   - Each recording was saved with a filename indicating its respective baffle length and angle (e.g., `a0.0__c0.mp3` for a length of 0.0 and angle of 0 degrees, `a1.5__c5.mp3` for a length of 1.5 and angle of 5 degrees, etc.).

3. **Analysis:**
   - An HTML file was generated to present the recordings. The recordings were organized into two columns based on the angle of the baffle (C).
   - The left column contains recordings with a baffle angle of 0 degrees (C0).
   - The right column contains recordings with a baffle angle of 5 degrees (C5).

### Results Presentation
- The HTML file displays audio elements for each recording, allowing for a direct comparison of the effects of different baffle lengths and angles on the sound produced by the saxophone.

### Conclusion
To gain a certain amount of brightness or edge to the tone of a mouthpiece,
a very short (1mm) baffle at a shallow angle gives similar results compared to
a medium-length (8mm) baffle using a steeper angle.
