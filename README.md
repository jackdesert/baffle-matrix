A study of rollover baffles of various lengths and angles

A study of baffle length and baffle angle.

Poses the question:
A study of baffle length vs baffle angle
The que

Say you are looking for a particular amount of edge in your tone.
Say you want to get that edge by incorporating a rollover baffle in your design.

This study demonstrates that for short baffles (8mm or less in length),
the amount of perceived edge is a function of at least baffle_length and
baffle_angle.

A3.0__C0: Just a tad brighter than I like
A2.3__C0: Aww, Yeah
A1.8__C0: Hot Damn!
A1.0__C0: Perfect
A0.7__C0: Gorgeous---a little smoother than I like
A0.5__C0: Milk Toast


A7.4__C5: Aww Yeah!

Jack's Favorites from listening to the recordings
-------------------------------------------------

Of the ones I said I liked when recording...the ones with the
shallower angle (and very short length) seem to have
more personality than the wider-angle-but-longer baffle.


BACKLOG
-------

- Practice scraping wax so you can get the exact measurement you are aiming for
- Sketch the diagram showing the two critical dimensions
- add millimeters to the index page
- Compute the reed angle
- Choose which ones from C0 match which ones from C5
- improve index.html by naming which one has no baffle
- Write this up and post on SOTW
- Repeat the measurements, at least for the ones that interest you the most
